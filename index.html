        <h3>Hello and welcome to my site!</h3>
        <p>I am currently a Associate Software Engineer in Training. I started my journey within the FOC as a Delay Analyst for Amrock.
            Not too long after, I was promoted as a Senior Delay Analyst within Amrock, owning many responsibilities within the role.
            Some time goes by and I was accepted into the DevBuild program with Grand Circus Detroit. Now I am currently finishing a near decade long journey
            into finishing my interest into programming.
        </p>
        <h3>Languages I'm Learning</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>C#</li>
            <li>HTML/CSS</li>
            <li>SQL</li>
            <li>Angular</li>
            <li>...and many more!</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Hometown</h3>
        <p>I was born in Wyandotte, MI. Grew up in Lincoln Park, MI. Went to school in Riverview, MI. But I currently live in Taylor, MI.
        Collectively those cities are centralized in area of Michigan called "Downriver" which basically means "area south of the Detroit River".
        Depending on where you are located, Downriver can mean many different things. I have friends that are afraid of the Downriver area because
        this is where they think all the freaks live. While that may or may not be true, it has been home to me my whole life...so what does that make me?<br><br>
